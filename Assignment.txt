Visualization Requirements
Your dashboard must include the following visualizations. Each visualization should reveal a meaningful business insight. Pay attention to the Expected Insight - this is what your chart should help viewers understand.
Section 1: Comparison Charts
1.1 Bar Chart - Channel Performance Comparison
•	Data Source: campaign_performance.csv

•	Interaction: Add trend line toggle, hover for customer details
4.2 Bubble Chart - Channel Performance Matrix
•	Data Source: campaign_performance.csv (aggregated)
•	Task: Plot CTR (x-axis) vs. Conversion Rate (y-axis), bubble size = Total Spend, color = Channel
•	Expected Insight: Email has best CTR-CVR combination; LinkedIn shows high CVR but lower CTR (quality over quantity); Large Google Ads bubble in mid-performance zone suggests optimization opportunity
•	Interaction: Hover to show all metrics, click to drill into channel
4.3 Heatmap - Correlation Matrix
•	Data Source: correlation_matrix.csv
•	Task: Display correlation heatmap between marketing metrics with diverging color scale
•	Expected Insight: Strong positive correlation between Spend-Impressions-Clicks; Negative correlation between ROAS and Spend suggests diminishing returns; Cart Abandonment negatively correlates with Conversions
